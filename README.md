# Tiny Braces
Improves code readability by compressing lines that contain only curly braces. It is compatible with Visual Studio 2013.

### Get it now!
[Download](http://github.com/owen2/little-braces/raw/master/Output/LittleBraces.vsix), and open. Visual Studio will do the rest.

### Tweaking
You can edit `BraceLineScale.txt` in the extension's install directory to change the compression amount. I'm considering integrating into Visual Studio's settings.

### Removal
You can remove this from the Extension Manager. A restart of VS is required.

### Alternatives
This got lumped into Productivity Power Tools 2013. You can use that if you don't like this one. Or feel free to fork and add improvements.
