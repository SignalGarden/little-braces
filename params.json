{"name":"Tiny Braces","tagline":"Improve readability by squishing uninteresting lines!","body":"# Tiny Braces\r\nThis is a Visual Studio 2013 extension that will improve your code's readability by compressing lines that contain only curly braces or whitespace. You'll be able to see more lines and there will be less space between the code that sets off a block and the code that defines the block's body. It makes C# (and C++) more beautiful. \r\n\r\n### Get it now!\r\n[Download](http://github.com/owen2/little-braces/raw/master/Output/TinyBraces.vsix), and open. Visual Studio will do the rest.\r\n\r\n### Tweaking\r\nYou can edit `BraceLineScale.txt` in the extension's install directory to change the compression amount. I'm considering integrating into Visual Studio's settings. You can also fork the code and open pull requests.\r\n\r\n### Removal\r\nYou can remove this using the Extension Manager.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nThis got lumped into Productivity Power Tools 2013. You can use that if you don't like this one. Or feel free to fork and add improvements.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nOriginal version by lukesdm.\r\nMaintained by owen2. \r\nContributions from thierryseegers. \r\n\r\n### Send me some Bitcoin\r\n1JpSCv9P78SuKPXfZw4VGnNq7Hm7KVthsY","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
